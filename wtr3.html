                <p>I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to everyone I had the pleasure of working with across all my teams, as well as to everyone else who supported me throughout this work term.
                <br><br>I would also like to acknowledge Anne-Marie Zawadzki and Kate McRoberts, my co-op coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback, assistance with my resume, and guidance. I am very grateful for all the support and encouragement I have received.</p>
