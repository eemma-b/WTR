                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                    During my first work term, I contributed to the development of the CGI Experience Design System (EDS) by creating a React version of the existing Angular framework. In my second work term, I focused on designing a chatbot front end in Figma, which was utilized in two projects: one to assist EDS users in designing and creating pages and UIs more efficiently, and another for a file management system. I implemented these designs in both Angular and React. I also updated the current system to Angular 18 and Material 3, replaced legacy components, and incorporated design tokens to enhance consistency and maintainability.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Unique Aspects of the Job</strong><br>
                    As previously mentioned, one unique aspect of this job was that it was part of CGI's Women in STEM Excel (WiSE) co-op program, which offered many learning opportunities. In December, I participated in another hackathon, which provided a platform to apply my skills in a competitive and collaborative environment, further enhancing my problem-solving abilities. Throughout my time at CGI, I had the opportunity to interact and collaborate with a diverse group of professionals, including those with expertise in areas like machine learning and project management. This experience enriched my understanding and broadened my skill set.

                    <strong>Skills Required and Learning Experience</strong><br>
                    <p>The WiSE Co-op Program at CGI requires a range of skills, including proficiency in front-end languages such as HTML, SCSS, Typescript, and JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular and React. Knowledge of server-side programming in Python and Java, as well as familiarity with version control systems like Git. Success in this role requires strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, excellent communication skills, and the ability to work both independently and collaboratively. I developed a strong foundation of skills through my academic projects using languages like C, Java, and Python. These projects significantly improved my teamwork and communication abilities. On the job, I further enhanced these skills and learned new ones, such as improving my attention to detail and self-teaching abilities, as I had to teach myself several new technologies.</p>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>My time at CGI has been very rewarding. I contributed to various projects, from helping implement the new React version of the CGI Experience Design System (EDS) to designing a front-end chatbot UI using Figma. These experiences enhanced my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and communication skills. I also learned the importance of self-teaching new technologies. I participated in meaningful events like “Knitting and Crochet for a Cause,” where we created squares, combined them into a blanket, and donated it to those in need. We also had a second hackathon with all the co-ops, which was a great opportunity to collaborate, innovate, and apply our skills in a competitive yet supportive environment.</p>
                <p><br>Overall, the WiSE Co-op Program provided a strong foundation for my career. The supportive environment and diverse learning opportunities at CGI have improved my abilities to tackle complex challenges and contribute effectively to any team.</p>
