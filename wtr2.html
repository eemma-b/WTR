                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                    During my first work term, I contributed to the development of the CGI Experience Design System (EDS) by creating a React version of the existing Angular framework. In my second work term, I focused on designing a chatbot front end in Figma, which was utilized in two projects: one to assist EDS users in designing and creating pages and UIs more efficiently, and another for a file management system. I implemented these designs in both Angular and React. I also updated the current system to Angular 18 and Material 3, replaced legacy components, and incorporated design tokens to enhance consistency and maintainability.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Unique Aspects of the Job</strong><br>
                    As previously mentioned, one unique aspect of this job was that it was part of CGI's Women in STEM Excel (WiSE) co-op program, which offered many learning opportunities. In December, I participated in another hackathon, which provided a platform to apply my skills in a competitive and collaborative environment, further enhancing my problem-solving abilities. Throughout my time at CGI, I had the opportunity to interact and collaborate with a diverse group of professionals, including those with expertise in areas like machine learning and project management. This experience enriched my understanding and broadened my skill set.

                    <strong>Skills Required and Learning Experience</strong><br>
                    The job required a diverse set of skills, including proficiency in various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, as well as essential soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. I developed these skills both on the job and through various training sessions and workshops provided by CGI. My Software Development classes were particularly beneficial in understanding the business and project management aspects of the role, such as Agile and Scrum methodologies, which are commonly used in professional settings like CGI. The hands-on experience and continuous learning environment significantly contributed to my professional growth.</p>
